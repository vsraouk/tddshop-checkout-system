TDD Shop Checkout System Exercise


**Step 1: Shopping Cart**

Build a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.

• Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p

• Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost
- For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05

• Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates
  take a list of strings as input


**Step 2: Simple offers**

• The shop decides to introduce two new offers

• Buy one, get one free on Apples

• 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges

• Update your checkout functions accordingly

**Run Application**

• Run the Application and you can see the following output from pre-populated Items List Input.
- output with-out discount for 4 apples (0.60p each) and 3 oranges (0.25 each) is: 3.15
- output with discount for 4 apples (Buy 1, Get 1 Free) and 3 oranges (Buy 2, and get 1 Free) is: 1.7
